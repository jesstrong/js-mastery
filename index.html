            <h2>Inspiration for the game! The Cookie Clicker</h2>
            <p> Fred Doughman, started in 1986 making great cookies. 10 years later, he saw a need to go "online" and started to 
                sell cookies across the state of Ohio and the U.S. His son, who became a software developer thought about the 
                internet transcations of how many cookies where being sold. (record sales in 1994-2000) As the popularity
                increased for the cookies so did "gaming" online and the idea was born. "The Cookie Clicker Game" was created and 
                from that original idea, has created an exponetial growth in many versions of the game even to today.
                Premise for original game:  
                In the game Cookie Clicker you click cookies. For every cookie click, as you might have guessed, 
                the player receives a cookie. With the obtained cookies, the player can purchase things that help 
                generate cookies more rapidly. Initially, the player can start with purchasing cursors that help with 
                clicking on cookies but before long this escalates into obtaining cookie farms, factories, mines and 
                many other ludicrous cookie generators. Eventually, the game even lets the player research upgrades to
                increase cookie production. For all the cookies, cookie generators and upgrades obtained the player can 
                gain achievements. The game tracks many statistics that will accompany the player's ever expanding cookie 
                empire.</p>
